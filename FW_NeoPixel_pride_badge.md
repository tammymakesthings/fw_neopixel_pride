June is LGBTQ Pride Month. Celebrate your pride with this fun, animated piece
of electronic jewelry!

## I Don't Want to Read All This Stuff, I Just Want to Use the Thing!

If you just want to build one of these and run it, here's the quickstart:

1. Get all the parts in the [parts list](#parts-list).
2. Stack the NeoPixel Featherweight and the Feather M0 Express.
3. [Download the code](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/overview#creating-and-editing-code).
   Copy the code file `fw_neopixel_matrix.py` to the Feather, and rename it
   code.py.
4. Power up your Feather and go to the races.

If you want to know the process I followed to design this project and how the
code works, read on.

## Parts List

The following components are needed to build this project:

-   1 - Adafruit [Feather M0 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3403) (You
    can use a [Feather M4 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857) as well.
    If you use a non-Feather [CircuitPython](https://www.circuitpython.org/)
    board, you're on your own for working out the connections.)
-   1 - Adafruit [NeoPixel FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2945)
-   1 - Battery. This [Adafruit 400mAH LiPo](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3898)
    is a good choice, because it will fit between the stacked Feather and
    FeatherWing.

The following additional parts are optional but recommended:

-   1 - SPDT power switch (such as
    [this one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/805) from Adafruit)
-   1 - JST extension cable (such as
    [this one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1131)). We'll cut it
    apart to add a power switch to the circuit.
-   4 - skinny zip ties (such as
    [these](https://www.amazon.com/Tarvol-Nylon-Locking-Cable-White/dp/B01MRD0JRR))
-   [Pin backs](https://www.amazon.com/Shappy-Pieces-Brooch-Safety-Plastic/dp/B075R81ZSY/),
    chain, or other fasteners to wear your badge/pendant/etc.
